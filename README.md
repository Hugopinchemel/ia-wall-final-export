if you need this project, you can contact me on github.
```
https://github.com/Hugopinchemel
```

if you want to try the code yourself, you will need an OpenAi API key that you can get here:
```
https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
```

and you will need to create an .env file in the root of the project with the following content:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

then you can run the code with the following command:
```
node index.cjs
```

if you need more words, you can add puzzle words in the index.html file at the bottom of the file.

here is the structure of the puzzle words:
```
{color: 'red/green/blue', text: 'Idea'}
```
